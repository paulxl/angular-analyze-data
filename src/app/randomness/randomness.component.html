<p class="generalInfo">Random Numbers</p>

<h3>Creating an array of numbers from 0 - 9, {{this.testNumber}} times.</h3>
<p>So you can see random is not always equal with a range in this instance being: <span style="color:  #cd5815 ">{{this.graphRangeNumber}}</span></p>
<p>Hit the refresh in browser to see this change.</p>
<p>The good news: each refresh causes the order to change.</p>
<p>So maybe less calls to random, creates less predictability.</p>
